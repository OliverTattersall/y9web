        <h3>Explains and Justifies</h3>
            <p >Child Mortality is a huge issue around the world but many people don't know the high numbers of child deaths and information is all in boring tabular information which is hard to digest. Giving a easier, more digestable form of the data will further educate people and encourage them to help. </p>
        <h3>Constructs a detailed research plan</h3>
            <p id="p1"> These are the basic skills needed to develop a user-friendly website that displays data:</p>
            <ol id="ol1">
                <li>HTML, CSS, and Javascript</li>
                <li>Json data analysis and manipulation</li>
            </ol>
            <p id="p1">These are the skills that I need to develop to be able to build a better website:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Learn about charts on the canvas tag to allow myself to create a better visual representation of the data.</li>
                <li>Learn about the dropdown bar tag, option, to give the user a way to select which countries it wants to look at.</li>
                <li>Learn more about array manipulation so that I can better use the data.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Existing Products</h3>
            <p ><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT?view=map">World Bank</a> has a map of the world where darker parts are places are places with a higher child mortality. When you hover over a country, it gives the name of the country and the number of deaths per thousand live births. This gives an easier way for readers to grasp this information. It also shows a line and bar graph, the bar graph showing the world number of under-5 deaths per 1000 live births and the line graph showing the world number of under-5 deaths per 1000 live births over the years. These three graphs are very good visual representations of the child deaths around the world. The only thing that it is really missing is a better explanation of the graph and somewhere where it is easier to find a country's information instead of having to find it on the world map.</p>
        
            <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_infant_and_under-five_mortality_rates">Wikipedia</a> has a map of the world that is colour coded where hotter colours mean higher death rates. This map is not interactive and does not give the exact numbers of each country. To find that you have look down the website into tabular data. When look at the first table, it only gives the under-5 mortality for countries in the OECD, which is an organization that has most of the richest countries in it without having many of the poor countries. There is another list below but that is for infant mortality, under 1. Overall, this is not very digestable data and this is a website that could improve greatly with new graphs, better organization of data  and fewer links that confuse the reader.</p>
            
            <p> <a href="http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.ChildMort-1?lang=en">WHO</a> has a table of 28 years child mortality data for each country. You can only see one country at a time and to see other countries you have to scroll down but if you don't scroll down on the right place the entire page scrolls not just the data. This way of displaying data is very bad for the reader gets confused and bored very easily. Most people will only read data from the first country, Afghanistan, and ignore the rest. The table does have many years of data which is beneficial to see how humanity has progressed but there are too many years so it ends up being to much information. This website needs to better display its data.</p>
        
        <h3>Design Brief</h3>
            <p>Tabular data is boring and it is important for readers to be entertained so that they can better digest the data more easily and enjoy the website. My website will take data on child mortality from the <a href="http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.ChildMort-1?lang=en">WHO</a> and make it into data that will be easily digestable. The user will be able to pick any 2 countries and compare their child mortality. The data will pop up as a line graph or bar graph, depending on what the user wants. The website will not have any tabular data, unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_infant_and_under-five_mortality_rates">Wikipedia</a> and will have images and animations related to child mortality. My website will not have excess scrolling like <a href="http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.ChildMort-1?lang=en">WHO</a> but instead have be short, and concise to not lose the attention of the reader. </p>
