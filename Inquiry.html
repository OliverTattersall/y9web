        <h1>Inquiry & analysis</h1>
        
        <h3>Explains and Justifies</h3>
            <p >Child Mortality is a huge issue around the world but many people don't know the high numbers of child deaths and information is all in boring tabular information which is hard to digest. Giving a easier, more digestable form of the data will further educate people and encourage them to help. </p>
        <h3>Constructs a detailed research plan</h3>
            <p id="p1"> These are the basic skills needed to develop a user-friendly website that displays data:</p>
            <ol id="ol1">
                <li>HTML, CSS, and Javascript</li>
                <li>Json data analysis and manipulation</li>
            </ol>
            <p id="p1">These are the skills that I need to develop to be able to build a better website:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Learn about charts on the canvas tag to allow myself to create a better visual representation of the data.</li>
                <li>Learn about the dropdown bar tag, option, to give the user a way to select which countries it wants to look at.</li>
                <li>Learn more about array manipulation so that I can better use the data.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Existing Products</h3>
            <p ><a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT?view=map">World Bank</a> has a map of the world where darker parts are places are places with a higher child mortality. When you hover over a country, it gives the name of the country and the number of deaths per thousand live births. This gives an easier way for readers to grasp this information. It also shows a line and bar graph, the bar graph showing the world number of under-5 deaths per 1000 live births and the line graph showing the world number of under-5 deaths per 1000 live births over the years. These three graphs are very good visual representations of the child deaths around the world. The only thing that it is really missing is a better explanation of the graph and somewhere where it is easier to find a country's information instead of having to find it on the world map.</p>
