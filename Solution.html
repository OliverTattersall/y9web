    <p>I was able to achieve everything and hit all the success criteria I had wanted including, but not limited to, multiple pulldowns to compare data, the bar graph grows slowly to its full size through a canvas tag and animations, users are able to generate data at the click of a button, etc.

I kept most things the same from my design but I changed some of the CSS and how to move around my website. Originally, I had it planned that there would be a button at the bottom of the front page that went to the second page and there would be a button at the top of the second page that led back to the front page. Now, there is a bar at the top with a home icon and a information icon that when clicked leads to respective pages. If your on the home page and click the home icon, it will just refresh the page. I also decided to have a larger font size for “Pick 2 Countries” on the data page. I got rid of “click here for more information” at the bottom of the front page as well.
